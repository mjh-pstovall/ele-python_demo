    "# Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing in Python is semi-controversial. Some people consider it a core tenant to good programming, while others consider it a total rejection of what python is. The debate is the exact same as those who debate JavaScript vs. TypeScript. This author is under the impression that while typing python somewhat reduces flexibility, it more than makes up for it in the reduction of errors. In addition, it allows for modern environment tools like Pylance to offer more helpful suggestions based on the variable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All typing is unenforced, meaning it will potentially help intellisense catch errors but python will always attempt to run the script regardless of type matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will go over the typing library and how to use it to annotate code."
